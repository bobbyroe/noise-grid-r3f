# Improved Noise with @React-Three/Fiber

This project is a React application built using React-Three-Fiber and Three.js. It visualizes an animated grid of points with organic motion and color transitions, creating a sweet effect. The animation leverages the React-Three-Fiber library's `useFrame` hook.
